            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>This is the content of the page</p>
            <p>Whoa, this is heavy. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Uh, coast guard. You're George McFly. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.</p>
            <p>Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Perfect, just perfect. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please.</p>
            <p>No. I think we need a rematch. The storm. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.</p>
            <p>I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. The flux capacitor. Doc?</p>
            <p>Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Marty, is that you? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-</p>
            <p>Hi, Marty. Ahh. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.</p>
            <p>Holy shit. What, what? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.</p>
            <p>Doc. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.</p>
            <p>Thanks. Yeah. We never would have fallen in love. Huh? No, fine, no , good, fine, good.</p>
            <p>What the hell is a gigawatt? I hope so. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.</p>
            <p>That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. George: you ever think of running for class president?</p>
